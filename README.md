# Catch-Me-If-You-Can-
Write a simple application that creates the following GUI:  The application should have the following behaviour: - On initialisation, the application should randomly choose where to locate the "Click Me" button.  - When the user attempts to follow the instruction on the labelled button (i.e. to click it!), the application should detect the mouse movement into the display area of the labelled button and randomly relocate to another location onscreen. The user should never actually be able to successfully click the "click me" button!  - Clicking on any other button should produce no result.
